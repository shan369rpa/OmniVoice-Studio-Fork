"""
Incremental re-dub — Phase 4.1 (ROADMAP.md), the other defensible bet.

Given the current dub state + a prior state, compute the minimum set of
segments whose audio needs regenerating. A segment needs re-gen when any of
its *generation inputs* changed:

    text · target_lang · profile_id · instruct · speed · direction

Deterministic content hash per segment is the key. We store the hash on the
segment after every successful generation; when re-dubbing, we hash again and
only queue segments whose hash differs from the stored one.

This isn't full crossfade-at-the-edges yet — that comes with Phase 4.5. For
now the caller re-runs `/dub/generate` with a filtered segments list.
